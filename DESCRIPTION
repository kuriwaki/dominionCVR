Description: Dominion voting machines, used in many places such as Maricopa County, AZ,
 Orange County, CA, and San Francisco Couty, CA, export their cast vote records
 in JSON format. This R package provides a common interface to read such data 
 files into tabular form, with a C++ backend for speed gains.
